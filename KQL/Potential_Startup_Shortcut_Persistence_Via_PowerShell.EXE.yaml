description: 'Detects PowerShell writing startup shortcuts.

  This procedure was highlighted in Red Canary Intel Insights Oct. 2021, "We frequently
  observe adversaries using PowerShell to write malicious .lnk files into the startup
  directory to establish persistence.

  Accordingly, this detection opportunity is likely to identify persistence mechanisms
  in multiple threats.

  the command-line script that leads to the installation of a malicious DLL"
