description: 'Detects execution of the builtin "rmdir" command in order to delete
  directories.

  Adversaries may delete files left behind by the actions of their intrusion activity.

  Malware, tools, or other non-native files dropped or created on a system by an adversary
  may leave traces to indicate to what was done within a network and how.

  Removal of these files can occur during an intrusion, or as part of a post-intrusion
  process to minimize the adversary''s footprint.
