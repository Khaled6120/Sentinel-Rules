description: 'Detects the enabling of the Windows Recall feature via registry manipulation.
  Windows Recall can be enabled by setting the value of "DisableAIDataAnalysis" to
  "0".

  Adversaries may enable Windows Recall as part of post-exploitation discovery and
  collection activities.

  This rule assumes that Recall is already explicitly disabled on the host, and subsequently
  enabled by the adversary.
