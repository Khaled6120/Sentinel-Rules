description: 'Detects when an attacker tries to disable User Account Control (UAC)
  notification by tampering with the "UACDisableNotify" value.

  UAC is a critical security feature in Windows that prevents unauthorized changes
  to the operating system. It prompts the user for permission or an administrator
  password before allowing actions that could affect the system''s operation or change
  settings that affect other users.

  When "UACDisableNotify" is set to 1, UAC prompts are suppressed.
