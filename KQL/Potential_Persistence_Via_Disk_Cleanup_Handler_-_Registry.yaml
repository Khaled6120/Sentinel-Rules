description: "Detects when an attacker modifies values of the Disk Cleanup Handler\
  \ in the registry to achieve persistence.\nThe disk cleanup manager is part of the\
  \ operating system. It displays the dialog box [\u2026]\nThe user has the option\
  \ of enabling or disabling individual handlers by selecting or clearing their check\
  \ box in the disk cleanup manager's UI.\nAlthough Windows comes with a number of\
  \ disk cleanup handlers, they aren't designed to handle files produced by other\
  \ applications.\nInstead, the disk cleanup manager is designed to be flexible and\
  \ extensible by enabling any developer to implement and register their own disk\
  \ cleanup handler.\nAny developer can extend the available disk cleanup services\
  \ by implementing and registering a disk cleanup handler.\n"
