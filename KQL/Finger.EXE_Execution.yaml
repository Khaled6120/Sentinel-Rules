description: 'Detects execution of the "finger.exe" utility.

  Finger.EXE or "TCPIP Finger Command" is an old utility that is still present on
  modern Windows installation. It Displays information about users on a specified
  remote computer (typically a UNIX computer) that is running the finger service or
  daemon.

  Due to the old nature of this utility and the rareness of machines having the finger
  service. Any execution of "finger.exe" can be considered "suspicious" and worth
  investigating.
