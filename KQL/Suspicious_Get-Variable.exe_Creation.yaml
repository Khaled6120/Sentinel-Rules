description: 'Get-Variable is a valid PowerShell cmdlet

  WindowsApps is by default in the path where PowerShell is executed.

  So when the Get-Variable command is issued on PowerShell execution, the system first
  looks for the Get-Variable executable in the path and executes the malicious binary
  instead of looking for the PowerShell cmdlet.
