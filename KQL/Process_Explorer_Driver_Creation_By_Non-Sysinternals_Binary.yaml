description: 'Detects creation of the Process Explorer drivers by processes other
  than Process Explorer (procexp) itself.

  Hack tools or malware may use the Process Explorer driver to elevate privileges,
  drops it to disk for a few moments, runs a service using that driver and removes
  it afterwards.
