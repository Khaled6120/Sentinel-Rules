description: "Detects when an attacker modifies values of the Disk Cleanup Handler\
  \ in the registry to achieve persistence via autorun.\nThe disk cleanup manager\
  \ is part of the operating system.\nIt displays the dialog box [\u2026] The user\
  \ has the option of enabling or disabling individual handlers by selecting or clearing\
  \ their check box in the disk cleanup manager's UI.\nAlthough Windows comes with\
  \ a number of disk cleanup handlers, they aren't designed to handle files produced\
  \ by other applications.\nInstead, the disk cleanup manager is designed to be flexible\
  \ and extensible by enabling any developer to implement and register their own disk\
  \ cleanup handler.\nAny developer can extend the available disk cleanup services\
  \ by implementing and registering a disk cleanup handler.\n"
