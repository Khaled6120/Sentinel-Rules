description: 'Threat actors can use an older version of the auditpol binary available
  inside the NT resource kit to change audit policy configuration to impair detection
  capability.

  This can be carried out by selectively disabling/removing certain audit policies
  as well as restoring a custom policy owned by the threat actor.
