description: 'An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software,
  such as Team Viewer, Go2Assist, LogMein, AmmyyAdmin, etc, to establish an interactive
  command and control channel to target systems within networks.

  These services are commonly used as legitimate technical support software, and may
  be allowed by application control within a target environment.

  Remote access tools like VNC, Ammyy, and Teamviewer are used frequently when compared
  with other legitimate software commonly used by adversaries. (Citation: Symantec
