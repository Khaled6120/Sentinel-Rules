description: 'Detects a suspicious copy operation that tries to copy a program from
  system (System32, SysWOW64, WinSxS) directories to another on disk.

  Often used to move LOLBINs such as ''certutil'' or ''desktopimgdownldr'' to a different
  location with a different name in order to bypass detections based on locations.
