description: 'Detects PowerShell scripts that make use of the "Compress-Archive" Cmdlet
  in order to compress folders and files where the output is stored in a potentially
  suspicious location that is used often by malware for exfiltration.

  An adversary might compress data (e.g., sensitive documents) that is collected prior
  to exfiltration in order to make it portable and minimize the amount of data sent
  over the network.
