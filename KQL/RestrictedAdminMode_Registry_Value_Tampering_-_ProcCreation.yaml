description: 'Detects changes to the "DisableRestrictedAdmin" registry value in order
  to disable or enable RestrictedAdmin mode.

  RestrictedAdmin mode prevents the transmission of reusable credentials to the remote
  system to which you connect using Remote Desktop.

  process if the remote server has been compromise
