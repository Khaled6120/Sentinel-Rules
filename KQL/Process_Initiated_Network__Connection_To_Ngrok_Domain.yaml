description: 'Detects an executable initiating a network connection to "ngrok" domains.

  Attackers were seen using this "ngrok" in order to store their second stage payloads
  and malware.

  While communication with such domains can be legitimate, often times is a sign of
  either data exfiltration by malicious actors or additional download.
