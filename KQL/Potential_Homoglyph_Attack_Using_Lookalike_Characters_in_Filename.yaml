description: 'Detects the presence of unicode characters which are homoglyphs, or
  identical in appearance, to ASCII letter characters.

  This is used as an obfuscation and masquerading techniques. Only "perfect" homoglyphs
  are included; these are characters that

  are indistinguishable from ASCII characters and thus may make excellent candidates
  for homoglyph attack characters.
